# HIRING: Post-Baccalaureate Fellow

## Who we are:

Drs. [Daniel Pine](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/sdan/index.shtml) and [David Jangraw](https://davidjangraw.wordpress.com) are seeking applicants for a 1-to-2-year Post-Baccalaureate Fellowship position that would help us develop new machine learning-based approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. Our aims are to better understand the causes and mechanisms of certain psychiatric disorders, improve their definition and classification, and ensure the best treatment can be offered to psychiatric patients. We do this by identifying neuroscience-based phenotypes that map onto clinical phenotypes, and which can be targeted with novel treatments. 

## What you will do:

The fellow will help the lab apply cutting-edge methods to research on anxiety and mood disorders in young people. One line of research will focus on extracting characteristics of psychotherapy session data, such as therapist speech and facial expressions, that can predict patient clinical outcomes or changes in brain activity. Another will collect behavioral data on mood and rewards remotely using Amazon Mechanical Turk, then link observed changes in mood to brain activity patterns. 

All fellows in the lab will assist in data collection, including scheduling patients, accompanying them on their visits, running experiments, keeping careful documentation, and organizing sensitive clinical data. Motivated fellows also participate in data analysis, and this fellow in particular may assist in applying machine learning techniques to fMRI, behavioral, and video/audio data. 

This is an excellent opportunity to gain experience in clinical neuroscience. Fellows will have a chance to interact with patients and clinicians, and the group places a high priority on mentorship. Many fellows spend two years in the program to become more competitive when applying to a doctoral or medical degree program. More information on the NIH post-bac program can be found [here](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) (with FAQs [here](https://www.training.nih.gov/resources/faqs/postbac_irta)). This is a paid position with a [stipend](https://www.training.nih.gov/postbac_irta_stipend_levels) between $30,650 and $35,850 per year.

## Who you are:

Candidates with a strong computational background (especially a BS or MS in Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or Computational Neuroscience) who are interested in brain development and psychopathology are encouraged to apply. Requirements for this position include:
- Strong work ethic
- Organization and attention to detail
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills

Desirable experience includes:
- Coursework or research experience in psychology or neuroscience
- Programming experience in Python (preferably) or in R/Matlab
- Practical machine learning experience
- Knowledge of software for processing neuroimaging data

## How to apply:

The successful candidate will work jointly with Drs. Daniel Pine and David Jangraw, as well as post-doctoral fellows in the group. Please write to them (pined@mail.nih.gov, david.jangraw@nih.gov) with your resume or CV, using the email as the cover letter. Applicants considered for an interview will be required to fill out the [NIH post-bac application form](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta/apply). The National Institutes of Health is an equal opportunity employer.
