# HIRING: Research Coordinator for Human Subjects Research at the University of Vermont

## Who we are:

Dr. David Jangraw is seeking a research coordinator for his research group, the [Glass Brain Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/~brainlab/).
Dr. Jangraw is an Assistant Professor in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning.
He was trained at Princeton, Columbia, and the National Institute of Mental Health.
The lab's focus is "naturalistic neuroengineering": the use of new technology to study the human brain in realistic situations.
By understanding the brain as it operates in real life, we can pave the way for devices that detect problematic brain states in real-time and provide help or support, a sort of pacemaker for the brain.

## What you will do:

### Big Picture
As the Glass Brain Lab's research coordinator, you will assist Dr. Jangraw and senior lab members on projects that involve the collection of brain, behavior, and physiology data from human subjects. You will use cutting-edge tools like EEG, gaze tracking, fMRI, machine learning, virtual reality, and mobile monitoring.
You will help manage logistics and coordinate a team of undergraduates as they collect data using these tools with the eventual goals of learning more about the brain, decoding brain states, or predicting mental health outcomes.

### Day to Day
You will help manage an Institutional Review Board proposal detailing a set of experiments we will perform. You will then help recruit, consent, document, and pay participants in those experiments. You will also help collect and quality-check the data.
You will attend lab meetings in which you will brainstorm ideas, troubleshoot issues, and read relevant academic papers to learn about the state of relevant science.
Remaining time can be spent contributing to experiments & analyses as you are able.
This can include performing literature searches, designing experiments, writing Python or MATLAB code, and contributing to presentations and manuscripts.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- Strong initiative and ability to work through problems on your own
- Reliability and attention to detail
- Experience with the research process
- Demonstrated ability to work with specialized software and equipment
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills
- A positive attitude

Ideally, you would also have:
- Experience with a human subjects research study
- Experience with Institutional Review Board proposals and documentation (ethics reviews)
- Coursework in engineering, psychology, or neuroscience

## How to apply:

Please write to Dr. Jangraw at david.jangraw@uvm.edu to explain why you would be a good fit for the position, attaching your CV. You must also apply to the official job posting when it is posted.
Applicants will be considered on a rolling basis until the position is filled.
