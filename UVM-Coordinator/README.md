# HIRING: Research Specialist for Human Subjects Research at the University of Vermont

Official posting: https://www.uvmjobs.com/postings/70483

## Who we are:

Dr. David Jangraw and Dr. Robert Gramling are seeking a research specialist for their research groups, the [Glass Brain Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/~brainlab/) and the [Vermont Conversation Lab](https://vermontconversationlab.com/).

Dr. Jangraw is an Assistant Professor in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning.
His lab's focus is "naturalistic neuroengineering": the use of new technology to study the human brain in realistic situations.
By understanding the brain as it operates in real life, we can pave the way for devices that detect problematic brain states in real-time and provide help or support, a sort of pacemaker for the brain.

Dr. Gramling is a board certified (and practicing) palliative care physician and epidemiologist with research expertise related to the study of clinical conversations.
He is the head of the Vermont Conversation Lab of multi-disciplinary scientists dedicated to understanding and promoting human connection among those touched by serious illness.

## What you will do:

### Big Picture
As a research specialist, you will collect, manage, and analyze data from human subjects at UVM's College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences and the Larner College of Medicine. You will provide technical expertise including participant recruitment, IRB protocol development and adherence, neuroimaging and behavioral data collection, data management, and data analysis.  

### Day to Day
You will serve 4 functions:
1. Serve as primary external contact for both potential and existing research participants. Manage ongoing relationship with participants before, during, and after each participantâ€™s study participation. Execute recruitment plans for multiple research projects, ensuring consistency across projects and compliance with University protocols for human subjects. Find efficiencies and potential improvements in participant recruitment and participation.
2. Supervise undergraduate and graduate research assistants in collection of research data including staffing of research visits, monitoring completion of research tasks, participant recruitment, interaction with study participants upon entry to the study, lab, and during data collection. Write, submit, maintain, and amend IRB protocols. Ensure that current lab members are adhering to the agreements made in IRB protocols, as well as University and sponsor guidelines. Provide guidance on research operations to improve efficiency and standards.
3. Plan, conduct, and coordinate data management activities. Take on responsibility for creating, maintaining, backing up, and tracking data collected from the lab. Monitor safety and privacy protection of data. Serve as primary staff resource in the management of data sharing with sponsors and collaborators. Coordinate across research groups to standardize data management and find efficiencies. Serve as primary resource for informational requests regarding research operations and data management to principal investigators, collaborators, sponsors, and student researchers.
4. Analyze data collected by the lab. Create and/or execute quality assurance and analysis pipelines using Python and/or shell scripting. Work with lab members or the Vermont Advanced Computing Cluster to make analysis scripts accessible to other collaborators. Assist in the development of new research methods and design. Write up methods and results for publication. Participate in laboratory meetings on the science and logistics of research projects.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- A Bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering, computer science, neuroscience, biostatistics, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, or a related field.

Ideally, you would also have:
- Python coding experience
- Experience with managing research data
- Experience working with multiple studies with research participants
- Experience with IRB process preparation and routing
- Experience with neuroimaging and physiological data collection systems

## How to apply:

Please write to Dr. Jangraw at david.jangraw@uvm.edu to explain why you would be a good fit for the position, attaching your CV. You must also apply to the official job posting at https://www.uvmjobs.com/postings/70483.
