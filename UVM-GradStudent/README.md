# HIRING: Graduate Students for Naturalistic Neuroengineering Lab at University of Vermont

## Who we are:

Dr. David Jangraw is seeking a PhD student for his research group, the [Glass Brain Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/~brainlab/).
Dr. Jangraw is an Assistant Professor in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning. He was trained at Princeton, Columbia, and the National Institute of Mental Health.
The lab's focus is "naturalistic neuroengineering": the use of new technology to study the human brain in realistic situations.
By understanding the brain as it operates in real life, we can pave the way for devices that detect problematic brain states in real-time and provide help or support, a sort of pacemaker for the brain.

## What you will do:

As a graduate research assistant in the lab, you will work with Dr. Jangraw to find projects that merge the lab's mission and your own interests. Example projects include:
1. *Mindless Reading*: we can decode brain & eye signals observed while someone is reading to predict how well they'll do on a later comprehension quiz. Can we do it in real-time and intervene to help?
2. *The Aha Moment*: The attentional orienting response brain signal occurs when something captures your attention. Detecting it in real-life scenarios may shed light on ADHD & addiction.
3. *Automated Therapy Labeling*: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is the standard for treating anxious kids. To find out which elements help, we're training a deep learning system to detect therapist techniques.

You will use cutting-edge tools like EEG, machine learning, virtual reality, gaze tracking, fMRI, natural language processing, and mobile monitoring. You will collect data using these tools, write code to de-noise the signals, and use machine learning to decode brain states or predict mental health outcomes.
You will publish papers and attend conferences to share your findings with the world.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- A strong computational background (e.g., bachelor's degree in Engineering, Computer Science, Neuroscience, or related areas)
- At least 2 years of programming experience, ideally in Python or MATLAB
- Strong initiative and ability to work through problems on your own
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills
- A positive attitude

Ideally, you would also have:
- Experience collecting and analyzing human neuroimaging data (especially EEG or fMRI)
- Experience in natural language processing (NLP) or virtual reality (VR)
- Experience in machine learning, especially using open source machine learning platforms such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- Coursework listed on UVM's [Bioengineering PhD website](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/bme-phd) or [EE PhD website](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/ebe/electrical_engineering_ms_phd)

## How to apply:

Please write to Dr. Jangraw at david.jangraw@uvm.edu to explain why you would be a good fit for the position, attaching your CV.
Applicants will also be required to complete an application to UVM's Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or Neuroscience PhD programs [here](https://www.uvm.edu/graduate/application_instructions) by January 1.
