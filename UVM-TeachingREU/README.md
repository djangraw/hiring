# HIRING: Undergraduate (REU) to Help Develop Biosignal Decoding Class

## Who we are:

Dr. [David Jangraw](https://uvm.edu/~djangraw) is seeking applicants for a semester-long, paid Research Experience for Undergraduates ([REU](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cems_research_experience_undergraduates)) position to develop and test labs for a new project-based Biomedical Engineering course on biosignal decoding.
Dr. Jangraw is a new faculty member in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning. He is building this course to overcome the challenges of remote learning and give UVM students an exciting, hands-on engineering experience from their homes.

## What you will do:

You will work with wearable sensors such as the [Myoware](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/312488939/myowaretm-harness-the-power-of-your-muscle-signals) or [Bitalino](https://bitalino.com/en/plugged-kit-ble) and an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) to record electrical muscle activity (electromyography, or EMG) from your forehead, arms, and legs. You will then write software to decode the EMG data and determine what action you were performing. This process is how engineers might develop a prosthetic limb for an amputee that is controlled by their existing muscles. You will be the first to make this project work, drawing techniques from online forums and tutorials, academic papers, and conversations with experts. You will write Python code for recording, signal processing, machine learning, and visualization. Working closely with Dr. Jangraw, you will develop and test step-by-step instructions, in-class exercises, and homework assignments to present these projects clearly and engagingly to future students.

An undergraduate viewpoint will be essential in making sure the projects are challenging but achievable for students. With your help and input, we will develop a complete course that will be offered to undergraduates and master's students this Spring.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- A strong computational background (e.g., major in Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, and related areas)
- At least 1 semester of programming experience in Python (preferably) or MATLAB
- Strong initiative and ability to work through problems on your own
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills
- A positive attitude

Ideally, you would also have:
- Experience in machine learning (for example, training classification/regression models, performing cross-validation, visualizing results), especially using open source machine learning platforms such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- Experience with wearable sensors such as EMG, EEG, EKG, or PPG
- Experience with the Arduino
- Ability to understand circuits and wiring diagrams
- Experience as a teaching assistant or tutor

## How to apply:

Please write to Dr. Jangraw at david.jangraw@uvm.edu to explain why you would be a good fit for the position, attaching your resume or CV.
