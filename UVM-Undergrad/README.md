# HIRING: Undergraduate & Master's Students for Naturalistic Neuroengineering Lab at University of Vermont

## Who we are:

Dr. David Jangraw is seeking undergraduate and Master's students for his research group, the [Glass Brain Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/~brainlab/).
Dr. Jangraw is an Assistant Professor in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning.
He was trained at Princeton, Columbia, and the National Institute of Mental Health.
The lab's focus is "naturalistic neuroengineering": the use of new technology to study the human brain in realistic situations.
By understanding the brain as it operates in real life, we can pave the way for devices that detect problematic brain states in real-time and provide help or support, a sort of pacemaker for the brain.

## What you will do:

### Big Picture
As a research assistant in the lab, you will assist Dr. Jangraw and senior lab members on projects that merge the lab's mission and your own interests. Example projects include:
1. *Mindless Reading*: we can decode brain & eye signals observed while someone is reading to predict how well they'll do on a later comprehension quiz. Can we do it in real-time and intervene to help?
2. *Language Changes*: we will use natural language processing to better understand how people speak as they age and develop memory loss disorders, with an eye towards using speech to detect these issues automatically. 
3. *Automated Therapy Labeling*: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is the standard for treating anxious kids. To find out which elements help, we're training a deep learning system to detect therapist techniques.

You will use cutting-edge tools like fMRI, EEG, machine learning, virtual reality, gaze tracking, natural language processing, and mobile monitoring.
You and your labmates will collect data using these tools, write code to de-noise the signals, and use machine learning to decode brain states or predict mental health outcomes.

### Day to Day
Undergraduates typically play a leading role in data collection and organization, gaining experience and intuition for biological signals.
(Master's student roles will be somewhere between undergraduate and PhD student roles.)
You will attend lab meetings in which you will brainstorm ideas, troubleshoot issues, and read relevant academic papers to learn about the state of relevant science.
Undergrads and Master's students are expected to be active participants in these discussions.
Remaining time is spent contributing to experiments & analyses as you are able.
This can include performing literature searches, designing experiments, writing Python or MATLAB code, and presenting results to lab members and collaborators.

First-time undergrad lab members are volunteers or paid through a successful Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) application. After a semester, they may be able to transition into doing research for credit or pay.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- A strong computational background (e.g., BME or EE major with computational focus, CS major, or related coursework)
- At least 2 semesters of programming experience in Python or MATLAB
- Strong initiative and ability to work through problems on your own
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills
- A positive attitude

Ideally, you would also have:
- Coursework involving human neuroimaging data (especially EEG or fMRI) or neuroscience in general
- Experience in machine learning, especially using open source machine learning platforms such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

## How to apply:

We typically accept incoming students once per semester. Please refer to the BME program's document on [How to do BME Research](https://uvmoffice.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EBE/EYRr3CaU1NJCtIS4dKvusRgBRgT5VC98KgnJ6Cn7mbeTOQ?e=LG2ZNk) for application links, instructions, and deadlines.
