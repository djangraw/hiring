# HIRING: Undergraduate Students for Naturalistic Neuroengineering Lab at University of Vermont

## Who we are:

Dr. David Jangraw is seeking undergraduate students for his new research group, the [Glass Brain Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/~brainlab/).
Dr. Jangraw is a new faculty member in UVM's Electrical and Biomedical Engineering Department with experience in signal processing and machine learning.
The lab's focus is "naturalistic neuroengineering": the use of new technology to study the human brain in realistic situations.
By understanding the brain as it operates in real life, we can pave the way for devices that detect problematic brain states in real-time and provide help or support, a sort of pacemaker for the brain.

## What you will do:

### Big Picture
As an undergraduate research assistant in the lab, you will assist Dr. Jangraw and senior lab members on projects that merge the lab's mission and your own interests. Example projects include:
1. *Mindless Reading*: we can decode brain & eye signals observed while someone is reading to predict how well they'll do on a later comprehension quiz. Can we do it in real-time and intervene to help?
2. *The Aha Moment*: The attentional orienting response brain signal occurs when something captures your attention. Detecting it in real-life scenarios may shed light on ADHD & addiction.
3. *Automated Therapy Labeling*: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is the standard for treating anxious kids. To find out which elements help, we're training a deep learning system to detect therapist techniques.

You will use cutting-edge tools like fMRI, EEG, machine learning, virtual reality, gaze tracking, natural language processing, and mobile monitoring.
You and your labmates will collect data using these tools, write code to de-noise the signals, and use machine learning to decode brain states or predict mental health outcomes.

### Day to Day
Undergraduates typically play a leading role in data collection and organization, gaining experience and intuition for biological signals.
You will attend lab meetings in which you will brainstorm ideas, troubleshoot issues, and read relevant academic papers to learn about the state of relevant science.
Undergrads are expected to be active participants in these discussions.
Remaining time is spent contributing to experiments & analyses as you are able.
This can include performing literature searches, designing experiments, writing Python or MATLAB code, and presenting results to lab members and collaborators.

First-time undergrad lab members are volunteers. After a semester, they can transition into doing research for credit or pay.

### Joining Now

There are two things that make this an unusual time in the lab.
1. Coronavirus concerns are likely to affect in-person data collection. Expect a focus on existing datasets and remote data collection this Spring & Summer.
2. This is a new lab with no graduate students or post-docs, so undergrads will play a major role getting the lab up and running. This can include installing equipment, organizing the lab, and assisting with IRB protocols and grant proposals.

## Who you are:

You must have:
- A strong computational background (e.g., BME concentration in biosensing, major in EE or CS, or related coursework)
- At least 2 semesters of programming experience in Python or MATLAB
- Strong initiative and ability to work through problems on your own
- Excellent interpersonal and written (English) communication skills
- A positive attitude

Ideally, you would also have:
- Coursework involving human neuroimaging data (especially EEG or fMRI) or neuroscience in general
- Experience in machine learning, especially using open source machine learning platforms such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

## How to apply:

Please write to Dr. Jangraw at david.jangraw@uvm.edu to explain why you would be a good fit for the position, attaching your CV.
Applicants will be considered on a rolling basis starting after Dr. Jangraw officially joins UVM on December 1, 2020.
